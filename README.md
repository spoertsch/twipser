Twipser
=====================================

This is Twipser, a simple twitter clone created as a demo application for a play framework meetup at IPSWAYS.
This application was inspired by the talk "[All Work and No Play Doesn't Scale](http://parleys.com/play/51c38b03e4b0ed877035686c/)" from [James Roper](https://github.com/jroper/all-work-no-play-doesnt-scale).
